Every time you exit <strong>Invisibility</strong> with this exotic equipped you recieve the buff. With the aspect <strong>Stylish Executioner</strong> you will also go <strong>Invisible</strong> everytime you kill a target affected by <strong>Volatile</strong>. This makes the buffs infinite as long as you have ammunition and enemies to use said ammunition on. Keep in mind that <strong>Stylish Executioner</strong> has a small cooldown so stay <strong>Invisible</strong> for a second or two.<br><br>To add even more survivability to this build we are using fragments. When you create a <strong>Void Breach</strong> or an <strong>Orb of Power</strong> and pick up them you will recieve <strong>Devour</strong> that heals you on every kill and also extends it's own timer on every kill.",

You and your teammates will also get a <strong>Reserve Overshield</strong> and improved <strong>Class Ability</strong> regeneration after the finisher.",

The reason you will be able to <strong>Suspend</strong> most targets is due to a combination of <strong>Ensnaring Slam</strong>, <strong>Shackle Grenade</strong> and the exotic <strong>The Sixth Coyote</strong>. When all of these work together you will have a total of 3 ways to <strong>Suspend</strong> multiple targets, just remember not to use your normal dodge.<br><br>To add more lethality to the build <strong>Whirling Maelstrom</strong> is used. When you kill a target affected by a <strong>Strand</strong> debuff you will create a <strong>Tangle</strong> (has a 12 sec cooldown). When you destroy the <strong>Tangle</strong> a whirling <strong>Strand Mass</strong> that seeks out and damages targets will be created. When it kills a target it will also send out <strong>Unraveling</strong> projectiles.<br><br>Since you will be close and personal with your enemies be sure to take advantage of <strong>Woven Mail</strong>. You will get this by simply picking up <strong>Orbs of Power</strong> due to the fragment <strong>Thread of Warding</strong>.",

                endgame: "While this build can work in more difficult content you will most certainly die many times when trying to use <strong>Ensnaring Slam</strong> on enemies. Because of this reason i Recommend that you switch both of the aspects in this build.<br><br>Since <strong>Shackle Grenade</strong> also <strong>Suspends</strong> targets and is a much safer option I would recommend using the fragment <strong>Widow's Silk</strong>. This will give you two grenades instead of just one, similar to <strong>The Sixth Coyote</strong> and speaking of we must make it so that your exotic is still useful. Adding the aspect <strong>Threaded Specter</strong> will make it so a <strong>Strand Decoy</strong> is created everytime you <strong>Dodge</strong>. This will aggro all nearby combatants.<br><br>Changing these aspects will increase your <strong>Survivability</strong> a lot but you will lose out on your style points.",

You will gain <strong>25%</strong> more damage with your <strong>Golden Gun</strong> while this buff is active. You can activate <strong>Radiant</strong> by hitting a target with your <strong>Meele</strong> attack and everytime you kill an enemy with a <strong>Solar</strong> weapon your buff timer will be extended. This is because of the aspect <strong>Ember of Empyrean</strong> and it also works for the <strong>Restoration</strong> buff which will be mentioned later.<br/><br/>(<strong>IMPORTANT!</strong> At the time this build was created you cannot stand in a <strong>Well of Radiance</strong> when shooting the <strong>Golden Gun</strong> since that will remove your <strong>Radiant</strong> buff, simply step out of the <strong>Well</strong> as you shoot.)<br/><br/>Another important way to boost your damage will be with the help of <strong>Armor Charges</strong> and specifically two <strong>Kinetic Weapon Surge</strong> mods. Adding three of this mod will ruin your damage. To gain <strong>Armor Charges</strong> you will need to create <strong>Orbs of Power</strong> and pick them up. If you are playing with some friends you can also ask them to put on the mod <strong>Powerful Friends</strong> so the <strong>Orbs</strong> they pick up also grants you an <strong>Armor Charge</strong> if you are near them.",

As previously mentioned <strong>Solar</strong> kills will extend the timer of both <strong>Radiant</strong> and <strong>Restoration</strong> up to <strong>12</strong> seconds. If you can start your fight with a <strong>Healing Grenade</strong> and then kill a few squishier targets you will have a long timer of <strong>Restoration</strong> up as long as you can kill enemies.",

Another great thing about destroying the crystals is that it creates a <strong>Stasis Shard</strong> that will grant you an <strong>Overshield</strong> when picked up for extra <strong>Survivability</strong>.<br/><br/>Depending on your weapon of choice you will create a huge amount of <strong>Stasis Crystals</strong> that will serve to damage your foes and rechearge your <strong>Abilites</strong>.",

Enemies can simply move out of the aura and some might be impossible to get into an aura such as snipers.

Another great thing about destroying the crystals is that it creates a <strong>Stasis Shard</strong> that will grant you an <strong>Overshield</strong> when picked up for extra <strong>Survivability</strong>.<br/><br/>Depending on your weapon of choice you will create a huge amount of <strong>Stasis Crystals</strong> that will serve to damage your foes and rechearge your <strong>Abilites</strong>.",

Enemies can simply move out of the aura and some might be impossible to get into an aura such as snipers.

These are very important to the build since the fragment <strong>Whisper of Shards</strong> grants you a temporary boost to your grenade recharge rate when you destroy the crystals. Another great thing about destroying the crystals is that it creates a <strong>Stasis Shard</strong> that will grant you an <strong>Overshield</strong> when picked up for extra <strong>Survivability</strong>.<br/><br/>Depending on your weapon of choice you will create a huge amount of <strong>Stasis Crystals</strong> that will serve to damage your foes and rechearge your <strong>Abilites</strong>.",

When all of your defensive buffs are up you will be able to take quite a bit of damage but it is not reliable. Your <strong>Overshield</strong> will be quite easy to get but the debuff to enemies and the buff to you that is recieved from being inside a <strong>Duskfield Grenade</strong> can be very unreliable. Enemies can simply move out of the aura and some might be impossible to get into an aura such as snipers.
